We have two type of windows property storage.
One call is sessionStorage this will live untill you close the tab from browser.

Other one is localStorage this will live untill you cloe the browser 

If you will type down in console of browser like window.localStorage you will see method that you could use 


window.localStorage.setItem() you might set it only in string way
Just in case if you have object there you should convert it into json then assign into there

Example

const myobject= {name:"jakhongir"}
window.localStorage.setItem('here',JSON.stringify(myobject));

In this way you could store data into you localStorage;
